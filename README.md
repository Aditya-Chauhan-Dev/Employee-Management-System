# Employee Management System (Frontend Focus)

A modern **Employee Management System** built with **React + Vite** focusing heavily on frontend architecture, UI/UX, and state management. This project demonstrates how an admin can assign tasks to employees and how employees can track their task status — all without a backend, using **localStorage** as the data layer.
